## What is RCTV?

RCTV is an independent publication covering the intersection of artificial intelligence and video production. We track the tools, models, trends, and business shifts reshaping how video content is created, distributed, and consumed.

From generative AI models like Sora, Kling, and Seedance to the regulatory landscape around synthetic media, we cover what matters — without the hype.

## What We Publish

**Weekly Roundup** — Every Friday, we publish a concise briefing on the most important AI video and media developments of the week. Key stats, model updates, industry moves, and regulatory changes — distilled into a single read.

**Analysis** — Deeper dives into specific topics: model comparisons, workflow strategies, market shifts, and the business implications of AI-native content production.

**Tools & Resources** — Curated guides to the AI video production landscape for creators, studios, and media professionals.

## Who's Behind This

RCTV is run by a media technology veteran with over 25 years of experience in content distribution, digital media, and video platforms. Our editorial perspective is shaped by hands-on experience building and scaling video businesses — from early OTT platforms to YouTube networks reaching hundreds of millions of monthly views.

We're not just observers. We build with these tools, test the models, and understand the production workflows from the inside.

## Why "RCTV"

Four letters. Dot com. A name built for media.

RCTV.com has been under continuous ownership since its original registration, and the domain carries decades of history in broadcasting and media. We think it's the right home for a publication covering the future of video.
